# HOW YOU CAN CONTRIBUTE TO FLR DEVELOPMENT

## Report bugs

If you find any problem with the **FLR** packages, please do not hesitate letting us know.

You can report bugs at the issue page on each package github repository. For *FLCore*, for example, this is at

<https://github.com/flr/FLCore/issues/>

Or you can drop us a line at `flrteam@flr-project.org`.

## Comment on the documentation

Errors, shortcomings or any comment on the documentation of any **FLR** package can also be submited as an issue at the package issue page.

The **FLR** tutorials are hosted in the 'doc' repository, so issues on their content or functionality can be reported at

<https://github.com/flr/doc/issues/>

## Suggest improvements or additions

If you have an idea for something that could be added or made better in any **FLR** package, open it for discussion at the **FLR** mailing list

<https://lists.r-forge.r-project.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/flr-list>

## Contribute an example

If you have used **FLR** for your work and would like to show how it has helped, you could contribute an R Markdown (Rmd) document to the **FLR gallery**. Please fork the repository at

<https://github.com/flr/gallery>

and submit a pull request with your document. We will test it and upload it to the [**FLR** website](http://flr-project.org/gallery).

## Contribute code

We are more than happy to receive [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) on any of the **FLR** packages if you have new code or a bug fix. Your contribution will be recognized by the community.

## Increase FLR usage and awareness
