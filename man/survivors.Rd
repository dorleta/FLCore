survivors(object)

\item{object}{An FLStock with estimated harvest and abundances}
}
\value{
The abundances at age of the survivors, 'FLQuant'.
}
\description{
An FLStock object containing estimates of adundance at age ('stock.n') and
harvest level at age ('harvest'), is used to bring forward the population
by applying the total mortality at age ('z'). No calculation is made on
recruitment, so abundances for the first age will be set as 'NA'.
